    <p>Welcome to the sample ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app demonstrating the use of my Blob Service to interact with files in an Azure Blob Storage account.</p>
    <p>This sample demonstrates a "Lite" version of my Blob Service that does not contain the upload, download, and delete features.  Buttons that perform those operations are disabled.</p>
    <p>
        Click <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Files">Files</a> to see a demonstration of browsing, downloading, viewing, and deleting
        files from an Azure storage account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Upload">Upload</a> to see a demonstration of uploading a single file to 
        an Azure storage account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click <a asp-area="" asp-page="/UploadMultiple">Upload Multiple</a> to see a demonstration of uploading multiple files to
